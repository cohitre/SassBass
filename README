These are SASS files that I commonly use. Some of them are SASS versions of CSS files while others are collections of mixins and utilities.

reset.sass
A sass version of the YUI reset file.

css3please.sass
Mixin versions of the classes in css3please.com

simple_mixins.sass
Abbreviations of common CSS properties. Just in the purpose of saving keystrokes.
